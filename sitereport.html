    <h2>Introduction and Learning Experience</h2>
    <p>
      This portfolio website was developed as part of the CSY1063 Web Development module.
      The primary aim of the project was to demonstrate my understanding of HTML5, CSS3,
      responsive web design, and version control using GitHub.
      At the beginning of the module, I had limited experience in developing multi-page
      websites or applying semantic HTML elements correctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the module progressed, I gained a clearer understanding of the importance of
      structure and accessibility in web development. I began using semantic elements
      such as <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, and
      <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> appropriately.
      This significantly improved the organisation, readability, and maintainability of my code.
    </p>

    <h2>Design and Technical Decisions</h2>
    <p>
      The design of the website was intentionally kept clean and minimal to prioritise
      usability and readability. A consistent navigation bar is used across all pages to
      ensure intuitive user interaction. Neutral colours were selected to create a
      professional appearance and avoid unnecessary visual distractions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flexbox was used primarily for layout alignment, particularly within the navigation
      bar and general page structure. CSS Grid was implemented on the Projects page to
      demonstrate a different layout technique and to organise project cards efficiently.
      Media queries were added to ensure the website adapts effectively to mobile,
      tablet, and desktop screen sizes.
    </p>

    <h2>Development Process and Challenges</h2>
    <p>
      One of the main challenges encountered during development was achieving consistent
      responsiveness across different screen sizes. Initially, some elements did not scale
      correctly on smaller devices. This issue was resolved by replacing fixed widths with
      relative units and refining grid and flexbox configurations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Validation errors were also encountered, mainly due to incorrect nesting and missing
      attributes. These were resolved by using the W3C HTML and CSS validation tools.
      Screenshots of successful validation results are included as evidence of standards
      compliance.

    <h2>GitHub Usage and Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      GitHub was used throughout the development process to manage version control.
      Commits were made regularly across multiple days to document progress, including
      page creation, layout changes, styling updates, and bug fixes.
      This practice improved my understanding of incremental development and professional
      workflow management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, this project significantly improved my confidence in front-end web
      development and provided a strong foundation for future modules.
